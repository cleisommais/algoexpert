## Coding Patterns

### Sliding Window

    Repeated DNA Sequences
    Minimum window substring
    Longest substring without repeating characters
    Minimum size sub-array sum
    Best time to buy and sell stock

### Two Pointers

    Valid Palindrome
    Sum of three values
    Reverse words in a string

### Fast and Slow Pointers

    Happy number
    Linked list cycle
    Middle of the linked list
    Circular array loop
    Palindrome linked list

### Merge Intervals

    Insert Interval
    Interval List Intersections
    Employee fee time

### In-Place Reversal of a Linked list

    Reverse linked list
    Reverse nodes in k-group
    Reorder list
    Swapping nodes in a linked list
    Reverse  nodes in even length groups
    Swap nodes in pairs

### Two Heaps

    Maximize capital
    sliding window median
    find median from a data stream
    schedule tasks on minimum machines

### K-way merge

    Merge sorted array
    Kth smallest number in M sorted lists
    Find K pairs with smallest sums
    Merge K Sorted lists
    Median of two sorted arrays

### Top K elements

    Hth largest element in a stream
    Reorganize string
    K Closest points to origin
    Top K frequent elements
    Kth smallest element in a BST

### Modified Binary Search

    Search in rotated sorted array
    First bad version
    Random pick with weight
    Find K closest elements
    Single element in a sorted array

### Subsets

    Subsets
    Permutations
    Letter combinations of a phone number
    Generate parentheses
    Find K-Sum subsets

### Greedy Techniques

    Jump game I
    Boats to save people
    Gas Stations
    Two city scheduling

### Backtracking

    N-Queens
    Word Search
    House Robber III
    Restore IP address
    Sudoku solver
    Matchsticks to square

### Dynamic Programming

    0/1 Knapsack
    Coin change
    N-th tribonacci number
    Partition equal subset sum
    Word break II
    Minimum number of refueling stops
    Climbing stairs

### Cyclic Sort

    Missing Number
    First missing positive
    Find duplicate number
    Find the corrupt pair
    Find the first K missing positive number
